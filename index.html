    Hello, World! <br>
    Project 3 - Knox / Tract The Second<br>
    </p>
      <p>
      <p> "How then does it happen, that these acts, so repugnant to all divine and human laws, are suffered to exist?."</p>
      <p>
        <p>
    <p>"On all accounts therefore the lawfulness of the thing must be determined."</p>
      <p>
        <p>
      <p> "When the lords the bishops have declared their opinion of the divine law, an act of parliament will be suffienct to decide what shall be human law; and until that is declared, it would be presumption to offer any regulations to be made by the other."</p>
